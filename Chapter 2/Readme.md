<ul>
<li>first.py: A classic "Hello World" program.
<li>module.py: Demonstrates the use of an external module (pyjokes) to print a random joke.
<li>datatypes.py: Illustrates different basic data types in Python: integer, float, string, boolean, and None.
<li>input.py: Shows how to take integer input from the user and perform a simple addition.
<li>operators.py: Explores various operators in Python, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators, along with their truth tables.
<li>type.py: Demonstrates how to check the data type of a variable and perform type casting (e.g., converting an integer to a float).
<li>variables.py: Basic example of declaring and printing different types of variables (integer, string, float).
<li>variablesrules.py: Provides examples of valid and commented-out invalid Python variable naming conventions.
<li>prob1.py:
Adds two numbers input by the user.
Prints the complete "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" poem, illustrating the use of triple quotes for multi-line strings.
<li>prob2.py:
Calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another, based on user input.
Provides instructions on how to use the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) to print the multiplication table of 5. This is a conceptual guide rather than an executable script.
<li>prob3.py:
Checks and prints the type of variable assigned using the input() function.
Shows how to install and use an external module (pyttsx3) for text-to-speech functionality.
<li>prob4.py:
Uses a comparison operator to determine if one user-input variable (a) is greater than another (b).
A script that takes a directory path as input from the user and lists all its contents (files and subdirectories). It includes error handling for invalid paths.
<li>prob5.py: Calculates and prints the average of two numbers entered by the user.
<li>prob6.py: Calculates and prints the square of a number entered by the user.
